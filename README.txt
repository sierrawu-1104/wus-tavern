My site now includes two interactive JavaScript features:

1. Font Size Adjuster: Two buttons labeled A+ and Aâˆ’ increase and decrease the base font size (respectively) of the page for accessibility (in case it may be difficult for someone to read).

2. Theme Switcher: A "Switch Theme" button now toggles between light and dark modes using a CSS class; the light theme is the default and consists of my white + dark blue/cerulean color scheme, and the dark simply changes the backgorund to be a medium grey while maintaining text readability. This could help users that may want a lighter or darker theme to ease strain on eyes. Alternatively, it can also just be an arbitrary cosmetic preferencefor anyone accessing the site
